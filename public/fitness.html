    Set realistic goals. Start with small changes that you can stick to over time. Find activities that you enjoy. If you don't enjoy an activity, you're less likely to stick with it. Make exercise a part of your routine. Schedule time for exercise in your day just like you would any other important appointment. Find a workout buddy. Having someone to exercise with can help you stay motivated. Listen to your body. Don't push yourself too hard, especially when you're just starting out.
